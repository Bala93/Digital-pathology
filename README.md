# Digital-pathology
Digital pathology is an image-based information environment which is enabled by computer technology that allows for the management of information generated from a digital slide. Digital pathology is enabled in part by virtual microscopy, which is the practice of converting glass slides into digital slides that can be viewed, managed, shared and analyzed on a computer monitor. With the advent of Whole-Slide Imaging, the field of digital pathology has exploded and is currently regarded as one of the most promising avenues of diagnostic medicine in order to achieve even better, faster and cheaper diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of cancer and other important diseases.

## Breast Cancer Histology Images:
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among womend and a major cause of death worldwide. According to Nottinghan Grading system there are three important morphological features on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained slides for breast cancer grading. They are mitotic coutn, tubule formation, and nuclear pleomorphism. Among them,mitotic count is the most important biomarker.
